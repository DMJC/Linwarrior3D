/**
 * Framebuffer-Object for offscreen and texture rendering according to:
 * https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Framebuffer_Object_Examples
 * 
 * May change because it's said to deliver higher performance
 * to recycle one frame-buffer and just exchange the textures.
 * That is given they have the same size - which may/not be the case.
 * 
 * Basically it just works by creating textures for buffers and binding
 * them to the frame-buffer-object which is just a container for the bindings.
 * Once that is done the frame-buffer-object can be bound and unbound
 * to enable and disable rendering to that one instead of the usual
 * screen-frame-buffer.
 * 
 * There isn't much configuration of the buffer properties right now -
 * just using sensible usual quality values.
