Your Keyboard is used to emulate a Gamepad, the keys are:

A,W for L1,L2
G,R for R1,R2

S for [] (square)
E for ^ (delta)
D for X (cross)
F for () (circle)

Arrow-Keys for A1 (Analoug Axis 1)
Komma "," for A1-Button

JIKL (like AWSD) for A2 (Analoug Axis 2)
Period "." for A2-Button

Alt-JIKL for Digital Coolie-Hat (or Digital Steering-Cross)


ASCII-Art of the Keyboard Layout (Monospaced Font):

 W/E\R   /I\
A/SDF\G /JKL\


Gamepads
--------

A Gamepad can be used alongside the Keyboard-Mapping.

Currently only a popular kind of game pad is used as the reference layout.
Through standardization several manufacturers deliver the same layout
whereas native pc game pads come in all impossible input-layouts.

These can be connected using a cheap to-usb-converter with older analog
versions (hereafter called gp2) or directly via usb in case of the later
version 3 (hereafter called gp3). I do believe that later upcoming versions
(gp4 in 2013) will provide the same layout and hopefully compatibility.

-------------------------------

A1  Throttle and Steering
A2  Turret Body
