# About this script and scripting
#
# This is a crude shell like scripting language.
# Note that comments should start with a # and have a space before any text.
#
# There are only commands which take arguments.
#
# set <key> <value>:
#   For a given key put a value into the environment used by subsequent commands.
#   The environment already contains values from the global properties file -
#   it is the same property map.

# Set vertical position automatically to ground level when placing entities (not yet).
set entity.grounded true

# Set mech's own flag
set mech.faction /faction/red

# Radio is yet un-read on spawn (for call-group).
set mech.radio /faction/red/all

# Set enemy flag (technically this could be a vector of flags but the script doesn't supports that yet).
set mech.enemies /faction/blue

# Dead enemies will be ignored
set mech.exclude /health/dead



# Attention, values for set-command shall not contain whitespace!
# (value = one arg)
